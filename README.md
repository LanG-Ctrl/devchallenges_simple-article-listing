<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This project was developed as a solution to the "Simple Article Listing" challenge from devChallenges.io. The objective was to create a responsive article listing layout using clean and accessible code. Below is a brief overview of what I have learned and implemented during this project.


### What I learned

While working on this project, I improved my skills in the following areas:

Responsive Design: I practiced creating a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes, using both CSS Flexbox and Grid.
Semantic HTML: I used semantic tags to ensure that the page structure is clear and accessible.
CSS Custom Properties: I utilized CSS variables to make styling consistent and maintainable.
Optimization for Retina Displays: I implemented srcset for images to provide higher resolution assets for devices with a higher pixel density.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs - Responsive Images - This guide helped me understand how to use srcset and sizes for responsive images.
CSS-Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox - A comprehensive guide to using Flexbox, which I referenced for layout adjustments.
MDN Web Docs - Semantic HTML - A great resource for understanding and applying semantic HTML elements.

### Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
CSS Grid

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a DevChallenges challenge. The following features were implemented:

Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
Semantic HTML elements for improved accessibility.
Clean and maintainable CSS using custom properties.
Retina-friendly images using srcset.
